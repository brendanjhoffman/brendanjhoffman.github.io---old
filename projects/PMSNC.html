            <div class="subheading mb-3"><h3><b>The <span class="text-primary"> ambitious</span> one.</b></h3></div>
            <p class="lead mb-5">In Spring 2019, my fraternity brother/alum and college friend Angelo Calinga came to me with an ambitious opportunity: an electronic medical record for his family's non-profit organization, the Philippine Medical Society of Northern California. During their annual missions in Bancoor, staff used hand-written records to keep track of their patients over the course of a week.
            <br><br>
            <b>The <span class="text-primary">Problem</span>:</b>
            <br>
            The week-long mission took place in a school gym with no internet connectivity. This meant every form of telecommunication was restricted to either Bluetooth or a LAN connection. The hardware used ranged from Mac's, PCs, Androids, and iPhones.
            <br><br>
            <b>The <span class="text-primary">Solution</span>:</b>
            <br>
            I knew that the different hardware would restrict to developing a Web App on a local network. I decided to develop using the WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin) tech stack. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Thoughts, Process, and <span class="text-primary">Reflection</span></b>
            <br>
            The timing for this couldn't have been better. By this time in college, I had just finished my Software and Requirement Engineering classes. My first elicitation meeting with the Calinga family clarified the work flow and what the apps core functionality was. After a bit of research, I found that Apache runs servers that other LAN users can access, SQL can handle the database backend, and PHP would communicate between the user and the server.
            I remember sitting at a motel room desk on a trip to Portland, and feeling the thrill of finally getting "Hello World" to show up on \\localhost:8080 - because this was the first time I've worked with PHP, HTML, SQL, and all the networking that went into local apps. There were nights in the following months where I would stay up until 5 A.M. coding because I said I'd have a feature added by the morning after. I really owe a lot of that project to Stack Overflow, W3 Schools, and Geeks for Geeks, most of that time was spent researching on those sites. And this wasn't paid, or an internship, but I persevere because I said I would.
            ...and it was worth every minute. January 27th, I got the follow up email I've been waiting for. <b>Seven thousand</b> patients were successfully tracked over the course of a week. I'm really proud of this project because not only was it for a good cause, but I taught myself the technology, applied what I learned in classes, and stuck to a self-disciplined work schedule.</p>

              <p>Hey Brendan,
 
                I hope your holidays and new year were happy and eventful! I’m back from the medical mission and wanted to give a small update about how the mission went.
                 
                We arrived in the city of Bacoor, Cavite with one afternoon to set up. We set up our router and held another EMR training session a day before the mission started. We were able to connect 50+ different iPhones, iPads, Mac/PC’s to the EMR. The medical mission was held in a small gymnasium about the size of a high school basketball gym. The patient workflow was:
                 
                triage (vitals) à registration (enter patient into EMR, get patient ID#) à physician/dentist/optometrist à possible referral to specialist à back to physician.
                 
                EMR Highlights
                 
                Patient ID#:
                Everyone was thankful for the patient ID#. This made it easy for doctors to retrieve and share information with other doctors. It also made it faster for returning patients who could bypass registration and go immediately to see the doctor. For example, when we had reached patient capacity for the day we would at the very least register the patient and then tell them to return the next day with their patient ID#.
                 
                Picture attachment function:
                This was used for every patient who visited ultrasound. The radiologist would note up a pdf chart on his iPad denoting the area of the body he had looked at. He would then take a picture of the pdf and attach it to the patient file. The radiologist would then send the patient back to see the physician where she could look at the attached chart.
                 
                The mission lasted five days, with four out of the five days going from 8am to 5pm. Over the course of the week we saw over 7,000 patients, all of whom were entered into the EMR. The EMR really made data collection for the mission more efficient and accurate. It gave assurance to all the health professionals at the mission that no information would be lost in translation, which ultimately leads to better patient care. The EMR project itself has also revitalized the organization as a whole, by facilitating large progress and change in the way our medical missions are now being conducted going forward.
                 
                Overall, I’d like to say thank you for taking on the project in the first place and seeing this project through. I just wanted to make sure you knew that your work has really helped our organization and the people of Bacoor, Cavite. I’ll be meeting with the organization again soon to wrap up the 2020 medical mission, so I’ll update you again sometime in the future. I also invite you check out the Facebook page to see pictures of the mission: https://www.facebook.com/pmsnc/
                 
                Thank you,
                Angelo                 
                </p>
